Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nStripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nAs a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nWork on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers\nGive meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs\nEnsure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users\nBuild the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills\n\n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present\nExperience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)\nAbility to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nOne or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request\nExperience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems\nFamiliarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases\n\n\nIn-office expectations\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is CA$106,400 - CA$159,600. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nSpecific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process.

Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWPP is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe's public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.\n\nWPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success, as stripe.com is often a user’s first impression of the company, and the vast majority of signups come via the website. We’ll apply data-driven rigor to our curiosity, and we’ll come up with clever ways to get insight into important questions. We’ll have the leeway to test out-of-the-box ideas alongside incremental ones. We’ll apply Stripe’s users-first mentality both internally and externally, crafting tangible productivity and quality-of-life improvements for colleagues while maintaining and elevating the quality of stripe.com.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nAs a software engineer, you will design and build platforms & services that are configurable and scalable around the globe. You will partner with many functions at Stripe, with the opportunity to both work on infrastructure/platform systems, as well as produce direct user-facing business impact.\n\nOrganizations is one of Stripe’s biggest bets. You will be joining a team with an ambitious and exciting goal at an early stage, with several opportunities to solve complex engineering problems at scale. If this sounds exciting, we’d love to speak with you.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDesign, build, and maintain scalable, reliable and performant services and systems\nWork with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve technical and product problems\nBuild and launch new capabilities and products that bring significant value to customers\nUphold our high engineering standards, and elevate quality and engineering efficiency within our many codebases and processes\nCollaborate with stakeholders across the organization including dependency engineering teams, product, design, infrastructure, and operations\nDebug production issues across services at multiple levels of the stack. \n\n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\nStrong technical background, including 3+ years of experience as a backend engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.\nExperience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.\nEmpathetic, collaborative, and user-first mindset in everything you build\nInterest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users\nAbility to stitch together many different services together even if you have not worked with them before\nPreference for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and having a good intuition for what is lasting and scalable\nThe skills to build holistically – from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact\nAbility to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levels\nExperience mentoring and growing junior engineers as their technical leader\n\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nFellow engineers feel they are able to learn from you, and you care deeply about mentoring others\nPropensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparency\nYou are often cited as the inspiration for engineers that join your team\nYou’ve worked to build pricing tooling that scales \n\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nIn-office expectations\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nWorking remotely at Stripe\n\nA remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

Our mission depends on having a digital representation of the physical world - a map with all routing related (real-time) information. This is what makes Lyft different from many products: our products don’t just facilitate online interactions, they facilitate dynamic, real-world ones. Without mapping services, none of these real world interactions between people and transport can happen.\n\nThe Mapping organization at Lyft has spent the last few years building up Lyft’s mapping assets and capabilities by combining many internal and external data sources and services into an increasingly powerful and mission-critical technology stack. In doing so, we’ve also enabled new user experiences and features across all of Lyft’s products, including rideshare industry leading firsts like CarPlay, Android Auto, and real-time driver feedback!\n\nWe are hiring a Frontend Software Engineer to join our Mapping experiences team that crafts next generation operational, debugging, analytical and tasking platforms.

Accommodation for persons with disabilities will be provided upon request in accordance with applicable law during the application and hiring process. Please contact your recruiter if you wish to make such a request.\n\nLyft highly values having employees working in-office to foster a collaborative work environment and company culture. This role will be in-office on a hybrid schedule — Team Members will be expected to work in the office at least 3 days per week, including on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Lyft considers working in the office at least 3 days per week to be an essential function of this hybrid role. Your recruiter can share more information about the various in-office perks Lyft offers.
